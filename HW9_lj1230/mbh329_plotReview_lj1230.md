### Reviews
- Clarity: Lack of xlabel, ylabel and legends makes the plot really hard to understand at first glimpse
- Esthetic: 
  - The title can be split into two lines to make it look better
  - The colors is not chosen appropriately. I would recommend colors used in HW7 as a reference
- Honesty: In general, the visualization is honest
